With a partner, create a story that has multiple different choices that the main protagonist can make, resulting in multiple different ways in which the story can go and how the characters influence the events that take place. In addition to the story, a program will be created in which the user is able to make different choices based on the story and the characters within it - this will be done by using prior knowledge of coding languages, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to create web pages and buttons that the end user is able tointeract with. The story should have multiple endings that branch out from different decisions that the user can make, certain decisions will inevitably lead to one ending, while other decisions may or may not lead to another ending. In the end, the users decision will dictate what happens in the story. The story will have three possible starting branches, and 3 real endings. In the story, the character will also need to progress throught the '12 steps of the hero's journey'.
